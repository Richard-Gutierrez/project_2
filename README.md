# ![](https://ga-dash.s3.amazonaws.com/production/assets/logo-9f88ae6c9c3871690e33280fcf557f33.png) Project #2: Building Your First Full-stack Application

### Overview

This second project is your first foray into **building a full-stack application.** You'll be **building a Rails app,** which means you'll learn about what it takes to build a functional application from the ground up yourself.

**This is exciting!** It's a lot, but by the end of the week we will have given you the all of the tools needed to build your app.  Here's the best part - you get to decide what you want to build - as long as it meets the technical requirements outlined below.

**You will be working individually for this project.** You'll be designing and coding the app yourself. We hope you'll exercise creativity on this project. Make sure you have time to run these ideas by your instructors to get their feedback before you dive too deep into user stories and wireframes! Remember to keep things small and focus on mastering the fundamentals – scope/feature creep is the biggest pitfall for any project!

### Technical Requirements

Your app must:

* **Have at _least_ 2 models** (more if they make sense) – one representing someone using your application, and at least one more that represents the main functional idea for your app.
* **Include sign up/log in functionality**, with authentication from scratch (`has_secure_password`). Implement basic authorization by restricting access to certain features, such as editing and deleting a resource, to an authenticated user.
* **Have complete RESTful routes** for at least one of your resources with GET, POST, PUT/PATCH, and DELETE.
* Have **semantically clean HTML and CSS.**
* Be **deployed online** (Heroku) and accessible to the public.

---

### Necessary Deliverables

* A **working full-stack application, built by you**, hosted on Heroku.
* A ** git repository hosted on Github** for your app with frequent commits dating back to the **very beginning** of your project. Commit early, commit often.
* A **link to your hosted working app** in the GitHub `README.md` file.
* Also in the `README.md` file:
	* Explanations of the technologies used.
	* Installation/startup instructions.
	* Unsolved problems, etc.
* A **Trello board** with:
	* **Wireframes of your app**.
	* **User Stories**, each moving from left to right in the following three lists in your board: Ice Box, Current and Completed.  Prioritize your user stories within the Ice Box with your "wish list" stories at the bottom.

### Suggested Ways to Get Started

* **Begin with the end in mind.** Know where you want to go by planning with wireframes & user stories, so you don't waste time building things you don't need.
* **Read the docs for whatever technologies you use.** Most of the time, there is a tutorial that you can follow, but not always, and learning to read documentation is crucial to your success as a developer.
* **Commit early, commit often.** Use feature branches. Frequent commits means you don’t have to be afraid to break something.
* **User stories define what a specific type of user wants to accomplish with your application**. It's tempting to just make them _todo lists_ for what needs to get done, but if you keep them small & focused on what a user cares about from their perspective, it'll help you know what to build.
* **Write pseudocode before you write actual code.** Thinking through the logic of something helps.
* **Don’t hesitate to write throwaway code** to solve short term problems.

### Potential Project Ideas

##### Cheerups
The world is a depressing place.

Your task is to create an app that will allow people to create and share "cheerups" - happy little quips to brighten other peoples' days. Cheerups will be small - limited to 139 characters. Members will be able to promote Cheerups that they like and maybe even boost the reputation of the Cheerupper.

##### Bookmarket
You will create an application where users can bookmark links they want to keep.

But what if users could trade bookmarks for other bookmarks? Or sell bookmarks for points? Or send bookmarks to your friends. Or something even crazier.

##### Photo sharing app
Users will be able to register and create albums and photos. Albums and photos will need to be named and described by their owners. Users will be able to view other users' albums. Maybe users can comment on photos, or either up/down vote them.

### Project Feedback + Evaluation

* __Project Workflow__: Did you complete the user stories, wireframes, task tracking, and/or ERDs, as specified above? Did you use source control as expected for the phase of the program you’re in (detailed above)?

* __Technical Requirements__: Did you deliver a project that met all the technical requirements? Given what the class has covered so far, did you build something that was reasonably complex?

* __Creativity__: Did you added a personal spin or creative element into your project submission? Did you deliver something of value to the end user (not just a login button and an index page)?

* __Code Quality__: Did you follow code style guidance and best practices covered in class, such as spacing, modularity, and semantic naming? Did you comment your code as your instructors as we have in class?

* __Deployment and Functionality__: Is your application deployed and functional at a public URL? Is your application free of errors and incomplete functionality?

* __Total__: Your instructors will give you a total score on your project between:

    Score | Expectations
    ----- | ------------
    **0** | _Incomplete._
    **1** | _Does not meet expectations._
    **2** | _Meets expectactions, good job!_
    **3** | _Exceeds expectations, you wonderful creature, you!_

 This will serve as a helpful overall gauge of whether you met the project goals, but __the more important scores are the individual ones__ above, which can help you identify where to focus your efforts for the next project!
